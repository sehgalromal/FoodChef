# Project Primary Goal 

To fulfil the main goal, we created a page that has video, a list of ingredients, a list of utensils, step-by-step instructions, and the description of a recipe. This app also provides search functionality to its users, so they can search a recipe from Firebase Realtime Database using it. The result of the search will be in grid-view of cards with name, duration and image of the recipes. Users can search for the recipes using the search bar. It allows text and voice input.
